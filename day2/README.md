## Refer

Stick with the official tutorial for docs on topics we have seen so far.

  - https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops
  - https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#pass-statements
  - Git and GitHub: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git This is just one of numerous resources available online. You should be able to code in your environment and push it to GitHub for collaboration.

## Practice

  - Improvise the guessing game from yesterday by providing 3 tries to the player
  - Given a list `['a', 'b', ...]` print elements along with their position like `0: a`, `1: b` one per line
  - Loop over a dict and print the value and key in the format `value belongs to key`.
  - Demonstrate the `else` clause being invoked in a while loop. try the opposite as well.
  - write an add function that accepts two numbers and returns their sum
    - use type hints
    - use docstring
  - write a function that accepts any number of args and prints them to the screen one per line
  - write a function that accepts any number of kwargs and prints the number of orgs
  - write a function that accepts any number of args and/or kwargs and prints the count of both
  - Go through PEP 8, and try refactoring your code
  - Go through PEP 20 and let me know your fav one!
  - Do a while loop with and without else block getting invoked
  - Do list comprehension to get odd numbers' squares from this list: [1, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6]
  - write a lambda expression to return average given a total and count

## Bonus Challenges

These are a bit advanced. If you cannot finish it today, try it out tomorrow after the class.

  - Try list comp to get keys that are longer than 4 chars in a dict
  - implement nested list comp in any use case
