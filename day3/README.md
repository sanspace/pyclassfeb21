## Practice

  - dictionaries
    - given a list of numbers (`nums = [1, 2, 3]`) use dict comprehension to create a dict of squares `{ 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9}`
    - make a list of values alone from the above dictionary `[1, 4, 9]` using list comprehension
  - set comprehension
    - given a list `[1, 2, 5, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5]`, create squares of unique items using set comprehension. `{1, 4, 9, 16, 25}`
  - Given a list of tuples with current and min balances: `[("Guido", 2000, 500), ("Raymond", -52, 1000), ("Jack", 900, 1000), ("Brandon", 2000, 0)]` use comprehensions to get the below:
    - dict of those with proper balances (above or equal min bal)
        `{"Guido": 2000, "Brandon": 2000}`
    - set of all balances
        `{2000, -52, 900}`
    - list of account holders
        `["Guido", "Raymond", "Jack", "Brandon"]`
    - dict of user and money each need to fulfill the min balance requirement (those who already have enough bal should not be in the dict)
        `{"Raymond": 1052, "Jack": 100}`
    - list of tuples with name and current balance if the balance is above 0
        `[("Guide", 2000), ("Jack", 900), ("Brandon", 2000)]`

  - Write a `Developer` class that has a `code` function and a `languages` list.
    - `code` function should accept a `language` param and if the `language` is in the `languages` list it should print `code in <language>`.
    - `resume` function that prints `languages` of the developer.
    - Write a `SrDeveloper` class that inherits `Developer` and adds `review` function. `review` should also be limited to `languages` list.
    - Write a `TechLead` class that inherits from `SrDeveloper` and adds `design` function

  - create a class that provides the factorials for the list of numbers provided. 

  - import a func from a module and call it to print some output
  - import a func and rename it to use in your module from another
  - create a module that prints "I'm running" only when it's ran as a script (not as a module using import)
  - use python to open another python source file and print the contents


## Extra Mile

  - Checkout `__repr__` and `__str__` methods and implement those for your class
  - see what other dunder methods interest you and let me know your fav
