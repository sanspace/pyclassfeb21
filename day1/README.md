## Practice

  - Python Environment
  - Code Editor / IDE (personal preferene)
  - Github account and repo (this is where you'll push following programs)
    - Needless to say, no personal/company (empID, project etc.) data on Github.
  - Programs
    - Given a list of names, try printing unique names that are less than 5 character length and doesn't contain the character 'e'.
      - `names = ["john", "jake", "jack", "george", "jenny", "jason"]`
    - Given a string `python`, try printing `cython` using slicing `[start:stop]` and concatenation. `+`
    - Given a dictionary `{"name": "python", "ext": "py", "creator": "guido"}`, print both keys and values.
    - Do FizzBuzz in Python
    - Guessing Game. Accept a guess number and tell us if it's higher or less than the hardcoded number
