## Practice

  - Allow users to view the developers (an index view), view their skills (a detail view) and up their skill level (add a form in the detail view) using function based views
  - Achieve the same using generic views
  - Add tests using the Django Testing helpers to your Django app
    - Test your models
    - Test your views
