## Practice

  - Extend your test cases from yesterday with what you learnt today
  - Add some styling to your app using stylesheets (`.css` files)
    - Add static dir and put your stylesheets in there
    - Refer these in your templates
  - Customize your admin form
    - Change the field order
    - use the fieldsets
    - try other available features (optional)
  - Just read about what DRF (Django Rest Framework) is and what it offers on top of Django.

## Bonus Challenge

  - Try part 1 of the DRF Tutorial with a twist
    - create an app called Programs that you can use to add your assignment programs
    - let's use the small programs from week 1 for testing this app
    - the models and serializers would be very similar to the Snippets one in the tutorial
      - the twist is to add the task description (program requirement) also as a field to the model
    - you're not developing the full app yet. it will be built in parallel along with the Snippets tutorial.
