## Practice

  - Try SQLAlchemy to persist data into a SQLite data base
    - use any data, demo the read, write capabilities using python
  - Try the same, but add marshmallow to dump the data as JSON
  - Go back to the first week's programs and add unit tests for a program of your choicce
    - a couple of tests using doctest
    - a test class using unittest
    - a test file using pytest

## Bonus Challenge
