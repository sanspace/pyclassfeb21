## Practice

  - Make a generator to perform the same functionality of the iterator
  - Try overwriting some default dunder methods and manipulate their default behavior
  - Write a decorator that times a function call using `timeit`
    - start a timer before func call
    - end the timer after func call
    - print the time diff

## Extra Mile

  - Implement your favorite design pattern
